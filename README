# Just another TeX CV 

A CV in TeX heavily inspired to the famous Friggeri's CV (Thanks - https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) 

## Getting Started

You must have latex installed. In fact, you'll see that you need XeLaTeX. There are loads of tutorial on where and how you can get LaTeX installed on your machine (Linux, macOS, Windows). 

## Running the test

First, run XeLaTeX twice
```
xelatex CV_EN_co.tex
xelatex CV_EN_co.tex
```
Then run biber and XeLaTeX again
```
biber CV_EN
xelatex CV_EN_co.tex
```
