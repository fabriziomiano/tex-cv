\cvsection{Overview}

IT enthusiast with competences in Machine learning, Full stack Python development, system administration, and cloud architecture at R2M Solution, focused on research activities within the scopes of robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, energy saving, and IoT domains. Previously, Data Science consultant for Leonardo company involved in the development of machine learning algorithms and AI solutions applied to public administration and defence with focus on team management, project coordination time- and budget-wise. 
Briefly, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of Sussex working on deception detection, and Junior Data Scientist in collaboration with Deckchair.com working on the development of an AI algorithm capable of selecting and classifying interesting images (fireworks, sunset, sunrise, etc.) within a dataset.
In 2018 I graduated as a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving, time management, coding (Python, C++, HTML, Bash), to carry out data analysis of high rates and volumes of data collected by the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva). During my PhD I have been invited to give talks at national (UK), and international (US), conferences; I have also participated in outreach activities to engage with the general public.
