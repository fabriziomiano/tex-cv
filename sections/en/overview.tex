\cvsection{Overview}

I am a Data Scientist at Leonardo working on a number of AI projects within the scopes of public administration, and defence, mainly focusing on text mining, and natural language processing (NLP). I have lately been focusing on the development of a deep learning tool for the extraction of named entities by means of pattern matching. A conditional random field to support the text annotation task. Previously, as a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex, I was focusing on the development of a machine learning algorithm for the classification of video of trials as truthful/deceptive. 

In 2018 I graduated as a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving, time management, coding (Python, C++, HTML, shell), to carry out data analysis of high rates and volumes of data collected by the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva). During my PhD I have been invited to give talks at national (UK), and interational (US), conferences; I have also participated in outreach activities to engage with the general public.
