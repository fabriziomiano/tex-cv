\cvsection{Overview}

ML Engineer, Full-stack Python developer, and System administrator at R2M Solution focused on research activities within the scopes of robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, energy saving, and IoT domains.

Previously Data Scientist at Leonardo working on a number of projects within the scopes of public administration, energy market, and defence. The projects I have been involved in required expertise on data crawling, text, audio, and image processing, as well as team management, project coordination time- and budget-wise. I briefly worked as a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex where I was focusing on the development of a machine learning algorithm for the classification of video of trials as truthful/deceptive. 

In 2018 I graduated as a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving, time management, coding (Python, C++, HTML, shell), to carry out data analysis of high rates and volumes of data collected by the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva). During my PhD I have been invited to give talks at national (UK), and international (US), conferences; I have also participated in outreach activities to engage with the general public.
