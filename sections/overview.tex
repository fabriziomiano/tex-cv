\cvsection{Overview}

I am a Data Scientist at Leonardo working on a number of AI projects within the scopes of energy market, public administration, and security, mainly focusing on computer vision, text mining, and natural language processing. Previously, as a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex, I was focusing on the development of an AI capable of classifying video of trials as truthful/deceptive. I did a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving, time management, and especially how to deal with high rates and high volumes of data from particle collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN, Geneva. 
% Signal extraction algorithms, signal-over-background optimisations (Python) modelling of regions of control (C\textit{++}), and estimation of uncertainties (MS Excel) were at the heart of the analyses I have carried out. Ultimately, I have developed a monitoring tool (Python) for the ATLAS Inner Detector Trigger that employs the creation and the management of a database.
% Previously, I joined a placement programme as a Junior Data Scientist at \href{http://www.deckchair.com}{Deckchair.com}. Here, I developed an algorithm capable of selecting interesting images within a given dataset, by exploiting the structural similarity index, and a machine learning tool for image classification. 


% By the end of my PhD I won a grant to work on an AI project: the development of an algorithm capable of selecting interesting images within a given dataset. I have spent 4 months working for \href{http://www.deckchair.com}{Deckchair.com} developing such an algorithm. In particular, two of the approaches that have been developed are; a statistical tool that exploits the structural similarity index (OpenCV, skimage); a machine learning tool (Scikit-Learn, keras, Tensorflow) for image classification. The project was timely delivered. As a Research Fellow in Data Science, I have moved to a new project: action recognition i.e. the classification of an action that is present in a given video. \\During my PhD the main skills I have developed are related to dealing with high-rates and high-volumes of particle-particle collisions data collected with the ATLAS detector at CERN, Geneva. Signal extraction algorithms, signal-over-background optimisations (Python) modelling of regions of control (C\textit{++}), and estimation of uncertainties (MS Excel) were at the heart of the analyses I have carried out. Ultimately, I have developed a monitoring tool (Python) for the ATLAS Inner Detector Trigger that employs the creation and the management of a database.
