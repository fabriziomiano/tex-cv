\cvsection{Overview}

I am a Data Scientist at Leonardo working on a number of AI projects within the scopes of public administration, and defence, mainly focusing on text mining, and natural language processing (NLP). I have lately been focusing on the development of a deep learning tool for the extraction of named entities by means of pattern matching and bg training conditional random field for text annotation. Previously, as a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex, I was focusing on the development of an AI capable of classifying video of trials as truthful/deceptive. 

In 2018 I graduated as a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving and time management, and Python and C++ code to carry out data analysis especially how to deal with high rates and high volumes of data collected by the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva). During my PhD I have been actively encouraged to give conference talks in the UK and US, and engaged with the general public in outreach activities.
