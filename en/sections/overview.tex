\cvsection{Overview}

I am a Data Scientist at Leonardo working on a number of AI projects within the scopes of energy market, public administration, and security, mainly focusing on computer vision, text mining, and natural language processing. Previously, as a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex, I was focusing on the development of an AI capable of classifying video of trials as truthful/deceptive. 

In 2018 I completed a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Sussex where I developed skills such as, problem solving and time management, and Python and C++ code to carry out data analysis especially how to deal with high rates and high volumes of data collected by the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva). During my PhD I have been actively encouraged to give conference talks in the UK and US, and engaged with the public in outreach activities.
